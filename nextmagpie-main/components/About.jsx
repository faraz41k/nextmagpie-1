            Magpies are indigenous birds in the Hunza Valley of Northern Pakistan. Its local name is
            “ghashep.” In Hunza, we believe that when magpies come to your home, especially in the
            mornings, they bring good luck. Magpies signal the arrival of guests that day. We chose the
            name Magpie Tours for the good fortunes that guests will bring to our home. Our company aims
            to provide quality travel services for adventures across Pakistan, with explorations of our rich
            cultural heritage, and signature treks and expeditions in the mountains.

            Magpie Tours is founded by a group of youth community activists from Hunza who are
            passionate about elevating the lives of our community, and taking up the opportunity of travel
            management to introduce the world and our homes to each other through responsible cultural
            exchange. Hunza has been the crossroads of civilizations since ancient times, and in this global
            age, more than ever, it is an enchanting place where people from every culture and background
            can meet and feel our lives change through this encounter. We want to be at the forefront in
            helping travellers discover and explore new worlds: the magnificent natural splendours of
            mountains and rivers, forests and deserts, and the ingenious ways of life and culture, art and
            architecture, food and music, developed and transmitted by the people living in these
            environments. On top of all this, it is the tremendous love that the local people shower upon
            guests that is often the most life-rewarding experience for travellers in Pakistan.

            Our tours are lovingly designed to introduce visitors to an experiential understanding of the
            unique history and cultures of Pakistan, following the civilizations that rose and fell along the
            mighty Indus River, exploring the ancient and modern heritage sites, as well as the adventurous
            routes that caravans and explores have traversed, the many silk routes that connect Central,
            West, South, and East Asia. But history is empty without people. A speciality of our tours is the
            chance for visitors to share a meal or tea with locals and listen to their real life stories in their
            homes, just like you are living with the community. For Magpie Tours, travel is a chance to
            experience life afresh, through all the different stories and possibilities you encounter along the
            way.
